## ✨ Highlights

**TaxaDiffusion** is a novel framework that tackles the challenge of generating **fine-grained species-level images** using diffusion models. Biological species often differ by subtle visual traits, making it difficult for standard generative models to capture and preserve these distinctions. To address this, TaxaDiffusion leverages the **hierarchical nature of biological taxonomy** to progressively condition and guide the generation process.

</p>


We propose a **stage-wise training strategy**, where the model is first trained on coarse taxonomic categories (e.g., Class or Order) and is gradually fine-tuned on finer labels (e.g., Genus and Species). This allows the diffusion model to **incrementally learn from general visual semantics to subtle, species-specific cues**.

**Key contributions:**

- 🧬 **Taxonomy-aware progressive training**: We introduce a novel multi-stage framework that conditions diffusion generation on biological hierarchy, improving structure and diversity.
- 🔁 **Stage-wise refinement of generations**: Each stage refines the model’s output by incorporating finer taxonomic labels, resulting in more accurate and biologically coherent species synthesis.
- 📊 **Comprehensive evaluation on three datasets**:
  - **FishNet** – 17,000+ fish species with high inter-class similarity.
  - **BIOSCAN-1M** – Microscopic images of 8,355 insect species.
  - **iNaturalist** – Diverse set spanning 10,000 plant and animal species.
- 🏆 **State-of-the-art results**:
  - Achieves superior FID and LPIPS scores for image quality.
  - Improves BioCLIP-based alignment between species text labels and generated images.
  - Demonstrates strong generalization across single-group and mixed-species datasets.
